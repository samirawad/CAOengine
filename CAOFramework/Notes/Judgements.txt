The judgements of the actor and target of an event depend upon the following:
- The tags that the observer has already assigned to the actor and target
- The ideals which the actor upholds or forsakes for the event.

How do we catagorize the feelings that actors have towards one another?  
The most concrete way would be by what they want from the object of the feeling:
  What they physically want to do or see happen to the objecty of their feeling
	- to kill
	- to protect
