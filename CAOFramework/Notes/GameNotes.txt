- Encounter stages
	- encounter prediction?
		- by skill of agent, things like tracks, recent events
	- encounter assesment
		- Asses the encounter, how dangerous it is? What is a likely outcome?
	- Actual encounter events
		- friendly / unfriendly
- Encounters of all kinds should also serve as a means of uncovering the personality traits of the party memebers.
	- groups and ideals priority
	- group definitions

- The opinions and judgements characters have towards one another depend on commonalities.  The degree to which they feel relateable.
- Perhaps we can use the idea of ideals and bonds.  

SELECTIONS:
- The final result of a selection is a dictionary of item paths which satisfy the conditions.  When the 'From' clause evaluates, we're seeding the dictionary with the previous values.
- If any of the dictionary entries are blank, then we can fail the associated action or outcome.

The opinion of Actor A1 on Actor A2 depends on the interatction of A1's traits with the memories where A2 plays a role.
Accessing an agent's list of memories which define their relationship to another character is a good way to create some storytelling moments dynamically.

It kinda gets complicated because the same action could be interpreted differently even by the same Actor.  A violent act towards a friend vs an enemy for example

Both occurences and actors are judged.
When an actor is part of an occurence they judge the actors by placing a type on them.
- Actor A thinks Actor B is a 'type'
- Actors have a preconcieved opinion of types, and place them in an order of importance for certain actions and feelings...?
- Drama occurs when something changes.
	- The order of imporatnce of a 'type'
	- The placing of a type on an actor by another
A person might think it's important to protect both friends and family. 
A good narrative event would be one where the Actor must:
	- Choose which is more important (order them)
	- Place or remove another actor from that group
	- Change their preconception of member of that group
There are good paralels between what I'm trying to define as an 'occurence' and how we set up a compelling scene.

For now, we could just have a simple ordering of groups.  The most important groups are the ones the actor want to 
protect, emulate, befriend

The different groups are ordered within the catagories of tribe and mate.  Tribe is who they identify with,
Mate is who they find desireable

Each Actor has these groups defined in their head, and attached to each group are a set of properties which describe how
that group behaves.  The development of an Actor is essentially the formation of the definitions of these groups and who belongs to them.

Loosely, a group is defined by how that group would behave in a situation.  This is the group's ideals and values.  The more important
a group is to an actor, the greater they will value the ideals of that group.

Self is a special group of one, but it recieves the same lables as all the other groups.  This could be narritively interesting because
we would like to see how the character sees himself, and perhaps cause cognitive dissonence

How is an occurence judged?
- It depends on the role the actor plays in the the occurence.
- he could be:
	- a witness
	- the subject of an action
	- the performer of an action
- A memory does two things:
	- affect the mood of the actor
	- affects his opinion of the other participants.
- An outcome could result in the Actor placing a "Label" on another Actor.
- We would still need a link to the memory, because we want to know what occurence was responsible for the label

The question then becomes how do we describe these judgements?
From a narrative perspective, drama occurs when we see an actor reveal what he wishes to protect or destroy in relation to others.
What his order of priorities are.
When a characters order of priorities are changed, this provides a narrative catharsis. 
 So this means that the most important events we can create are ones where the order is revealed or changed.
  
 A newly met actor might be placed immediately under a preexisting label, or they might start off in a label that just includes
 themselves, based on how stronly prejudiced the judge is.  As time progresses, the new actor will acumulate new labels himself.
 This could cause a number of things to happen
  - They might be moved to a new "Label"
  - The "Label" they currently inhabit could be redefined
  - A new "Label" might be created.

 Setting up the occurence as a scene:
 - An action / reaction structure : the gameworld changes somehow
 - Relationship management.  Opinions, memories etc...
 - A situation is encountered which requires a reaction or resolution
 - The purpose of an event is to reveal additional detail of an actor to other actors, and for actors to make a decision based on their priorities, ideals, goals, etc.
 
 - Every occurence has a list of participants, all of which are either acting or being acted upon

 - In addition to prioritizing groups of people, an agent would also have prioritized lists of ideals they uphold or forsake.
 - Could we link the groups and ideals that an agent upholds to the tags which are applied in response to occurences?
